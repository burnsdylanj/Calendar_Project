Step 1:

Create rough draft to make sure that the app is running and functions the way that it needs to

Step 2: 

Add more months to have a full year of a functioning calendar

Step 3:

Make it look pretty

Overview and ideas for the project:

Similar in design to Google calendar. Making a one month calendar so that we can have it working as a base and then making the rest of the year
and maybe future years after that. 

The idea is to have a calendar that can store information for daily events and times. 

---If we feel like being AMBITIOUS---

If given enough time the hope is that the calendar may be able to show the information for each day displayed on the day's tab. Another idea could be to have a calendar that, when the day is clicked on, displays an hour by hour list like the calendar on the iPhone.
