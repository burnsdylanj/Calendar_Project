11/5 - I haven't touched anything with this during the weekend as I am trying to catch up in math. Feel free to work on it if you want but don't feel too much pressure.
Maybe just look around for resources or guides on how to do things you want to do for the project. Feel free to ask any questions and I'll see you on Tuesday!
