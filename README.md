12/10/2023 UPDATE:

I apologize for not reaching out prior to this but I have obviously been away from class and it was due to my car issues. I am not sure if you guys made another github repository or not but if you haven't I just decided to make my own calednar. I tried making changes to the calendar that we had all been working on but due to being out of class I got lost in the changes that were made and I did not know how to help. Please feel free to change anything or make adjustments to the calendar I made (my name is in the file name for all the sections of it). If I do not hear anything I will see you all on Wednesday morning.

Overview and ideas for the project:

Similar in design to Google calendar. Making a one month calendar so that we can have it working as a base and then making the rest of the year
and maybe future years after that. 

The idea is to have a calendar that can store information for daily events and times. 

---If we feel like being AMBITIOUS---

If given enough time the hope is that the calendar may be able to show the information for each day displayed on the day's tab. Another idea could be to have a calendar that, when the day is clicked on, displays an hour by hour list like the calendar on the iPhone.
